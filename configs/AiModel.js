  The output needs to be a JSON array.
  Each element in the array represents a scene.
  Each scene object must contain:
  - \`imagePrompt\`: A realistic AI image generation prompt for the scene.
  - \`contentText\`: The narration/text for that scene.
  
  The total duration should be around 30 seconds. Let's aim for 3-5 scenes.
  The tone should be engaging and visually descriptive.
  
  **Scene Breakdown Plan:**
  
  *   **Scene 1 (5-7 seconds):** Start with a relatable struggle. Someone looking tired or uninspired. Set the scene of low motivation.
  *   **Scene 2 (7-10 seconds):** Introduce the idea of the "spark." A subtle shift, a moment of realization or a small action being taken.
  *   **Scene 3 (7-10 seconds):** Show the action building. Progress, effort being applied, overcoming a small obstacle. Focus on the *doing*.
  *   **Scene 4 (5-7 seconds):** End on a positive, forward-looking note. A sense of accomplishment or determination for the next step.
  
  **Constraint Checklist & Confidence Score:**
  
  1.  Write a video script: Yes
  2.  Short 30-second video: Yes (Plan estimates ~24-34 seconds)
  3.  Topic: Motivation: Yes
  4.  Realistic style: Yes (Prompts will focus on realism)
  5.  Breakdown into multiple scenes: Yes (4 scenes planned)
  6.  JSON format for each scene: Yes
  7.  \`imagePrompt\` field: Yes
  8.  \`contentText\` field: Yes
  9.  Engaging tone: Yes (Will use active language)
  10. Visually descriptive tone: Yes (Prompts and narration will aim for this)
  11. Output *only* a JSON array: Yes
  
  Confidence Score: 5/5
  
  **Mental Sandbox:**
  
  *   *Initial Idea:* Start with someone climbing a mountain. *Critique:* A bit clich√©. Let's try something more everyday and relatable.
  *   *Revised Idea 1:* Someone staring blankly at a laptop screen. *Refinement:* Good start. Then show them closing distracting tabs, maybe taking a deep breath.
  *   *Revised Idea 2:* Someone struggling to get out of bed. *Refinement:* Also relatable. Then show them putting on running shoes.
  *   *Revised Idea 3:* An artist looking at a blank canvas. *Refinement:* Then show a single brush stroke.
  
  Let's go with a mix - starting with general low energy, then focusing on a small, achievable action.
  
  *   **Scene 1:** Close-up, slightly low angle, on a person's face (mid-30s, any gender/ethnicity) slumped over a desk, messy papers, empty coffee cup nearby. Soft, slightly dim morning light filtering through blinds. Expression is tired, uninspired. Realistic photo style.
  *   **Scene 2:** Slightly wider shot. The person takes a slow, deep breath, closes their eyes for a moment, then opens them with slightly more focus. They gently push aside the messy papers, revealing a clean notebook and pen. Natural light, focus sharpens on the notebook. Realistic photo style.
  *   **Scene 3:** Close-up on the hand picking up the pen and writing the first word or sketching the first line in the notebook. Focus on the deliberate action. The background is slightly blurred. Warm, focused lighting. Realistic photo style.
  *   **Scene 4:** Medium shot. The person is now sitting up straighter, looking at their notebook with a hint of a determined smile or focus. Sunlight is a bit brighter now. A sense of quiet progress. Realistic photo style.
  
  **Narration Timing:**
  
  *   Scene 1 (6s): "Feeling stuck? Like the energy just isn't there?"
  *   Scene 2 (8s): "Motivation isn't a lightning bolt. Sometimes, it starts small."
  *   Scene 3 (9s): "A single breath. One simple step. The choice to just *begin*."
  *   Scene 4 (7s): "Find your spark. Take that first step. The rest will follow."
